Task #42: KrakenDB-patch-3D Implement database monitoring and alerting

1: Determine which metrics and events need to be monitored to ensure optimal database performance and availability.
You will need to determine which metrics and events are important for monitoring the database's performance and availability. These might include metrics like CPU usage, disk usage, network traffic, query execution time, and more.

2: Choose a monitoring and alerting tool or system that meets the project's requirements.
There are many different tools and systems available for monitoring and alerting databases, such as Prometheus, Nagios, and DataDog. You will need to choose a tool or system that meets the project's specific requirements, such as compatibility with the database platform and ability to monitor the desired metrics and events.

3: Configure the monitoring and alerting tool to collect and analyze the desired metrics and events.
Once you have chosen a monitoring and alerting tool, you will need to configure it to collect and analyze the metrics and events you have identified as important. This may involve installing agents or plugins on the database servers, setting up dashboards or visualizations, and defining rules or alerts for triggering notifications.

4: Set up alerts and notifications based on predefined thresholds or conditions.
You will need to set up alerts and notifications based on predefined thresholds or conditions, so that you can be alerted when specific metrics or events exceed certain thresholds or when predefined conditions are met. This might involve setting up email or text message notifications, integrating with a chat or collaboration tool, or sending alerts to a centralized logging or monitoring system.

5: Test the monitoring and alerting system to ensure it is working correctly.
You will need to test the monitoring and alerting system to ensure that it is working correctly and that you are receiving the expected alerts and notifications. This may involve running tests that simulate various failure scenarios, such as high traffic or database performance degradation, and verifying that alerts are triggered and notifications are received.

6: Integrate the monitoring and alerting system with the project's existing logging and alerting infrastructure, if applicable.
If your project already has an existing logging and alerting infrastructure, you may need to integrate the new monitoring and alerting system with it. This might involve configuring the new system to send alerts to the existing system, or setting up a new dashboard or visualization within the existing system.

7: Document the monitoring and alerting system and its usage instructions for future maintenance and troubleshooting purposes.
Finally, you will need to document the monitoring and alerting system and its usage instructions, so that it can be easily maintained and troubleshooted in the future. This may involve creating documentation that outlines how to configure, test, and troubleshoot the system, as well as best practices for monitoring and alerting database performance and availability.

Once you have completed all of these tasks, you can submit your changes for review and merge into the main codebase. Good luck with your Pull Request!
