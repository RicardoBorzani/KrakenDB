Tasks

1: Determine the archiving and purging requirements for the database
 - In this task, you should identify which tables or data need to be archived and how often data should be purged. Document these requirements to inform the design and implementation of the archiving and purging functionality.

2: Design a data archiving and purging strategy
 - Based on the requirements identified in the previous task, design a strategy for archiving and purging data. Consider factors such as the size of the database, the frequency of data changes, and the need to keep historical data for regulatory or business reasons.

3: Implement the archiving functionality
 - Implement the archiving functionality to move data from active tables to archive tables or files. Ensure that the archived data is stored in a way that is easy to retrieve and is consistent with the archiving strategy.

4: Implement the purging functionality
 - Implement the purging functionality to remove old or unnecessary data from the active tables or files. Be sure to test the purging functionality to ensure that it only removes the intended data and does not affect any other data in the database.

5: Create a backup strategy for the archived data
  - Develop a backup strategy for the archived data to ensure that it can be recovered if necessary. The backup strategy should be consistent with the archiving strategy and should take into account any regulatory or business requirements for data retention.

6: Write unit tests for the archiving and purging functionality
 - Create unit tests for the archiving and purging functionality to ensure that it works as expected and does not introduce any new issues or bugs. These tests should be included in the project's test suite and should be run automatically as part of the continuous integration pipeline.

7: Write integration tests
 - Write integration tests to validate that the archiving and purging functionality works with the rest of the system. These tests should simulate real-world usage scenarios and should be included in the project's test suite.

8: Update the documentation
 - Update the documentation to include information about the archiving and purging functionality and how to use it. This should include any configuration settings or instructions for setting up the archiving and purging system.

9: Refactor code to improve scalability and maintainability
 - During the implementation process, refactor code to improve its scalability and maintainability. This may involve removing duplicate code, improving the code's structure, or eliminating unnecessary dependencies. Be sure to write unit tests to ensure that the refactored code works as expected and does not introduce any new issues or bugs.
