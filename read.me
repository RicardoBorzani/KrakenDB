#30: KrakenDB-patch-1B Implement basic CRUD operations for a single table

1: Create a new table in the database with the required columns for the project:
 - Use the MySQL command-line interface or a graphical tool such as phpMyAdmin to create a new table.
 - Define the necessary columns for the table, including data types and constraints based on the project requirements.
 - Ensure that the table is properly normalized and optimized for performance.

2: Write functions to handle each CRUD operation: Create, Read, Update, and Delete, for the newly created table:
 - Write functions to handle each CRUD operation for the new table using the appropriate SQL statements.
 - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
 - Ensure that the functions are properly encapsulated and modularized for ease of maintenance and testing.

3: Ensure that each function is properly tested and that all test cases pass:
 - Write test cases for each function using a testing framework such as PHPUnit or Jest.
 - Ensure that the test cases cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
 - Run the test cases to ensure that they all pass before proceeding.

4: Implement error handling to handle invalid input and edge cases:
 - Write code to handle invalid input and edge cases, such as missing or invalid parameters, empty or null values, and out-of-range values.
 - Ensure that the error messages are informative and user-friendly.

5: Implement transaction management to ensure data consistency:
 - Use transactions to ensure data consistency and to prevent race conditions and other concurrency issues.
 - Wrap each CRUD operation in a transaction to ensure that it either succeeds completely or fails completely.

6: Ensure that all code is properly commented and formatted according to the project's style guidelines:
 - Review the code to ensure that it is properly commented and formatted according to the project's style guidelines.
 - Make any necessary changes to the code to ensure that it is consistent with the rest of the codebase.

7: Write a user manual that describes how to use the CRUD operations for the table:
 - Write a user manual that describes how to use the CRUD operations for the table, including any necessary login credentials, input parameters, and expected output.
 - Ensure that the manual is user-friendly and easy to follow.

8: Submit the changes to the code repository and verify that the build is successful:
 - Submit the changes to the code repository as a pull request, ensuring that all necessary files and documentation are included.
 - Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and approved by other team members.
 - Verify that the build is successful and that the changes have been properly integrated into the codebase.
