Task #39: KrakenDB-patch-3A Add support for sharding and replication

1: Research and choose a sharding and replication method that fits the project's needs.
You will need to research various sharding and replication methods and choose the one that best fits the needs of the project. This may involve looking at factors such as the size of the database, the number of users accessing the database, and the desired level of data redundancy.

2: Implement sharding and replication functionality.
Once you have chosen a sharding and replication method, you will need to implement it in the project. This will involve modifying the codebase to support sharding and replication, as well as integrating any necessary libraries or tools.

3: Write integration tests for sharding and replication.
To ensure that the sharding and replication functionality is working as intended, you will need to write integration tests that cover the various use cases and scenarios that may occur. These tests should be comprehensive and cover both normal and edge cases.

4: Update documentation to include sharding and replication instructions.
You will need to update the project's documentation to include instructions on how to use the new sharding and replication functionality. This should include information on how to set up and configure sharding and replication, as well as any other relevant details.

5: Test and optimize sharding and replication performance.
After implementing sharding and replication, you will need to test and optimize the performance of these features. This may involve running load tests to see how the system handles high levels of traffic, as well as profiling the code to identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

Once you have completed all of these tasks, you can submit your changes for review and merge into the main codebase. Good luck with your Pull Request!
