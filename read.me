#29: KrakenDB-patch-1A Set up database server and create initial schema

1: Install and configure the MySQL database server on the target machine:
 - Install MySQL database server on the target machine using the appropriate package manager or by downloading and installing the latest version from the official MySQL website.
 - Configure the database server according to the project's requirements, including network settings, security, and performance parameters.

2: Create a new database and name it according to the project requirements:
 - Use the MySQL command-line interface or a graphical tool such as phpMyAdmin to create a new database.
 - Name the database according to the project requirements, taking into account any naming conventions or restrictions.

3: Create the initial schema for the database, including all required tables, columns, and relationships:
 - Design the database schema based on the project requirements and best practices for database design.
 - Use the appropriate tools and syntax to create tables, define columns and data types, and set up relationships between tables.
 - Test the schema to ensure that it meets all requirements and is optimized for performance and scalability.

4: Verify that the schema meets all requirements and is optimized for performance and scalability:
 - Use tools such as the MySQL Workbench or command-line tools to verify that the schema is correct and meets all requirements.
 - Run performance tests on the schema to ensure that it can handle expected data loads and user traffic.
 - Optimize the schema as needed for performance and scalability.

5: Create a user account with appropriate permissions for accessing the database:
 - Create a new MySQL user account with appropriate permissions for accessing the database, including read, write, and execute permissions as needed.
 - Ensure that the user account has a secure password and that the password is stored securely.

6: Write scripts to populate the database with any necessary test data:
 - Write scripts or use tools such as MySQL's "LOAD DATA" statement to populate the database with any necessary test data.
 - Test the data to ensure that it is correct and matches the expected format.

7: Test the database connectivity and ensure that the schema is accessible and functional:
 - Use tools such as MySQL Workbench or command-line tools to test the database connectivity and ensure that the schema is accessible.
 - Run tests on the database schema to ensure that it is functional and can be used by the application.

8: Ensure that all code is properly commented and formatted according to the project's style guidelines:
 - Review the code to ensure that it is properly commented and formatted according to the project's style guidelines.
 - Make any necessary changes to the code to ensure that it is consistent with the rest of the codebase.

9: Create documentation for the database schema and usage instructions:
 - Create documentation for the database schema, including descriptions of tables, columns, and relationships, as well as any other relevant information.
 - Provide usage instructions for accessing and using the database, including any necessary login credentials and SQL statements.

10: Submit the changes to the code repository and verify that the build is successful:
 - Submit the changes to the code repository as a pull request, ensuring that all necessary files and documentation are included.
 - Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and approved by other team members.
 - Verify that the build is successful and that the changes have been properly integrated into the codebase.
