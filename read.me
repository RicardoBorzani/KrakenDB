#37: KrakenDB-patch-2D Implement backup and restore functionality

1: Research and evaluate different backup and restore strategies:
- Research different backup and restore strategies that are appropriate for the database system you are using. Consider factors such as backup size, backup frequency, backup storage, and restore time.
- Evaluate the pros and cons of each strategy and choose the one that fits the project requirements.

2: Choose a backup strategy that fits the project requirements:
- Once you have evaluated the different backup and restore strategies, choose the one that is the most appropriate for your project.
- Consider factors such as backup size, backup frequency, backup storage, and restore time.

3: Implement a backup system that can create regular backups of the database:
- Write code that can create regular backups of the database according to the chosen backup strategy.
- Implement error handling to ensure that the backup system runs smoothly and without interruptions.
- Use a consistent naming convention for backup files and store them in a safe location.

4: Implement a restore system that can restore the database from a backup:
- Write code that can restore the database from a backup file.
- Implement error handling to ensure that the restore system runs smoothly and without interruptions.

5: Write integration tests to verify the backup and restore functionality:
- Write integration tests that simulate the backup and restore processes.
- Use a test database or a test environment to perform these tests.
- Verify that the backup system can create a backup and that the restore system can restore the database from that backup.

6: Document the backup and restore system and usage instructions:
- Create documentation that explains how the backup and restore system works.
- Include instructions on how to use the backup and restore functionality.
- Include information on how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
