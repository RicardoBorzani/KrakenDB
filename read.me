#31: KrakenDB-patch-1C - Write unit tests for the CRUD operations

Tasks:
 - Identify all possible test scenarios for the CRUD operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
 - Write test cases for each scenario, ensuring full code coverage.
 - Use a testing framework, such as JUnit or PHPUnit, to write and execute the tests.
 - Ensure that the tests run successfully and all expected results are produced.
 - Use assertions to verify that the code behaves as expected and catches errors and edge cases.
 - Refactor the code as needed to improve testability and maintainability of the tests.
 - Document the unit tests and any testing assumptions made.

Steps:

1: Identify all the possible test scenarios for the CRUD operations:
 - For the Create operation, test cases could include:
   - Valid input data that creates a new record in the database.
   - Invalid input data, such as missing required fields, that should fail and not create a record in the database.
   - Creating a record with duplicate data that should fail.
 - For the Read operation, test cases could include:
   - Valid input data that returns a single record from the database.
   - Invalid input data, such as an incorrect ID or missing required fields, that should fail and not return a record.
   - Querying for all records in the table.
 - For the Update operation, test cases could include:
   - Valid input data that updates an existing record in the database.
   - Invalid input data, such as missing required fields or an incorrect ID, that should fail and not update a record.
   - Updating a record with duplicate data that should fail.
 - For the Delete operation, test cases could include:
   - Valid input data that deletes an existing record in the database.
   - Invalid input data, such as an incorrect ID, that should fail and not delete a record.

2: Write test cases for each scenario, ensuring full code coverage:
 - Write test cases for each identified scenario, ensuring that all possible code paths are executed and all edge cases are tested.

3: Use a testing framework, such as JUnit or PHPUnit, to write and execute the tests:
 - Use a testing framework such as JUnit or PHPUnit to write and execute the tests.
 - Ensure that the testing framework is set up correctly and that all dependencies are included.

4: Ensure that the tests run successfully and all expected results are produced:
 - Execute the tests and ensure that they all run successfully and produce the expected results.
 - Identify and fix any failing tests.

5: Use assertions to verify that the code behaves as expected and catches errors and edge cases:
 - Use assertions to verify that the code behaves as expected and catches errors and edge cases.
 - Ensure that all possible code paths are executed and that all edge cases are tested.

6: Refactor the code as needed to improve testability and maintainability of the tests:
 - Refactor the code as needed to improve testability and maintainability of the tests.
 - Ensure that the code is clean, concise, and easy to read.

7: Document the unit tests and any testing assumptions made:
 - Document the unit tests and any assumptions made during testing.
 - Include information such as the purpose of the test, the input data used, the expected results, and any special conditions or assumptions made during testing.
