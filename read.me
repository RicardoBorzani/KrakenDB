KrakenDB-patch-4C: Write integration tests for data archiving, masking, and encryption

This pull request aims to add integration tests for the data archiving, masking, and encryption features that have been implemented in the KrakenDB database. The following tasks need to be completed:

1: Identify the key scenarios to be covered in the integration tests: 
 - This involves reviewing the data archiving, masking, and encryption features to determine the critical scenarios that should be covered in the integration tests. Examples of scenarios to consider include encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, archiving and retrieving data, and masking data fields in different ways.

2: Write test cases for data archiving, masking, and encryption: 
 - Based on the identified scenarios, write test cases to cover these scenarios in the integration tests. The test cases should be designed to simulate realistic production scenarios and should cover both success and failure cases.

3: Set up a test environment to simulate production scenarios: 
 - Set up a test environment that simulates the production environment as closely as possible. This may involve setting up multiple nodes, sharding the database, and configuring replication and failover.

4: Execute the test cases and validate the results: 
 - Execute the test cases in the test environment and validate the results. The tests should confirm that data archiving, masking, and encryption are working correctly and that the database continues to function as expected.

5: Address any failures or issues found during the testing process: 
 - If any failures or issues are found during the testing process, address them by debugging and fixing the code as necessary.

By completing these tasks, this pull request will help ensure that the data archiving, masking, and encryption features are reliable, performant, and function as expected in the production environment.
