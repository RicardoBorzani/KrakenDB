KrakenDB-patch-4D Implement database performance tuning and optimization

Analysis
 - Analyze current performance metrics using appropriate tools and techniques to identify areas of improvement.
 - Identify any slow queries or bottlenecks that may be causing performance issues.
 - Document findings and recommendations for future reference.

Optimization
 - Optimize database schema and indexing strategy to improve query performance.
 - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of expensive queries.

Optimize database configuration settings, such as buffer sizes and query cache.
Analyze and optimize database queries for performance.
 - Evaluate hardware and infrastructure needs to support expected database loads.

Testing
 - Test database performance after implementing optimization changes to ensure that they have improved performance as intended.
 - Write unit tests and integration tests for optimized queries, caching mechanisms, and other performance optimizations.
 - Continuously monitor database performance and address any new issues or opportunities for improvement that arise.

Documentation
 - Document performance tuning and optimization procedures, including steps taken, tools used, and any relevant performance metrics.
 - Include instructions for future maintainers to identify and resolve performance issues as they arise.

By following these steps, we can optimize the database for improved performance, better support expected loads, and ensure that the database meets the project's performance requirements.
