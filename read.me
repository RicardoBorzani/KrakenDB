#43: KrakenDB-patch-3E Refactor code to improve scalability and maintainability

1: Review the existing codebase and identify areas that could be improved for scalability and maintainability.
 - Review the codebase and identify sections that are difficult to maintain or scale, such as overly complex methods or classes, and make note of them.

2: Identify code smells and anti-patterns, such as duplicate code, tight coupling, and complex conditional logic, and refactor them.
 - Identify code smells and anti-patterns and refactor them to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
 - For example, use inheritance and polymorphism to avoid duplicate code, use interfaces to reduce tight coupling, and simplify complex conditional logic.

3: Use design patterns and best practices, such as SOLID principles and dependency injection, to improve the overall structure and organization of the code.
 - Use design patterns and best practices to improve the overall structure and organization of the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend.
 - For example, use SOLID principles to improve the code's flexibility and maintainability, and use dependency injection to make the code more testable and modular.

4: Remove unused code and unnecessary dependencies to reduce the codebase's complexity and improve its performance.
 - Remove any unused code and unnecessary dependencies to reduce the codebase's complexity and improve its performance.

5: Add appropriate comments and documentation to make the codebase easier to understand and maintain by other developers.
 - Add appropriate comments and documentation to make the codebase easier to understand and maintain by other developers.
 - This includes documenting function and method signatures, as well as adding inline comments to explain complex logic.

6: Write unit tests to ensure that the refactored code works as expected and does not introduce new bugs or issues.
 - Write unit tests to ensure that the refactored code works as expected and does not introduce new bugs or issues.
 - This includes testing both new and existing functionality, and ensuring that the codebase remains stable and functional after the refactoring.

7: Perform code reviews and solicit feedback from other team members to ensure that the refactored code meets the team's standards and goals for scalability and maintainability.
 - Perform code reviews and solicit feedback from other team members to ensure that the refactored code meets the team's standards and goals for scalability and maintainability.
 - This includes addressing any concerns or feedback raised during the review process.

8: Continuously monitor the codebase and address any new issues or opportunities for improvement that arise during the development process.
 - Continuously monitor the codebase and address any new issues or opportunities for improvement that arise during the development process.
 - This includes addressing any new code smells or anti-patterns that arise, as well as addressing any new performance or scalability issues that arise.
