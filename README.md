# KrakenDB
Relational database server based on MySQL. The KrakenDB is a fast and reliable database that can handle large volumes of data. It provides advanced security and scalability features, including database replication and clustering.

## Sprint backlog

### Sprint 8: Initial Setup and Basic Functionality.

#### Description: 
The goal of this sprint is to set up the database server and create the initial schema. You will also implement basic CRUD operations for a single table, write unit tests to ensure that they work correctly, and implement connection pooling and transaction management. Finally, you will document the database design and usage instructions.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a working database server with a basic schema and support for CRUD operations, connection pooling, and transaction management. You should also have a set of unit tests and documentation to ensure that the database works correctly and is easy to use.

- Set up database server and create initial schema (5 points)
- Implement basic CRUD operations for a single table (8 points)
- Write unit tests for the CRUD operations (3 points)
- Implement connection pooling and transaction management (5 points)
- Document database design and usage instructions (3 points)

### Sprint 9: Indexing, Transactions and Backup.

#### Description: 
The focus of this sprint is to improve database performance by implementing indexing and query optimization. You will also add support for transactions across multiple tables, implement backup and restore functionality, and refactor the code to improve scalability and maintainability. Finally, you will write integration tests to ensure that the CRUD operations and transactions work correctly.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a database server with improved performance through indexing and query optimization, support for transactions across multiple tables, and backup and restore functionality. You should also have a set of integration tests that ensure the CRUD operations and transactions work correctly. Additionally, you should have refactored code that is more scalable and easier to maintain.

- Implement indexing and query optimization (8 points)
- Add support for transactions across multiple tables (5 points)
- Write integration tests for the CRUD operations and transactions (3 points)
- Implement backup and restore functionality (5 points)
- Refactor code to improve scalability and maintainability (5 points)

### Sprint 10: Sharding, Replication and Monitoring.

#### Description: 
The goal of this sprint is to add support for sharding and replication, implement data partitioning and distributed transactions, and refactor the code to improve scalability and maintainability. Additionally, you will implement database monitoring and alerting and write integration tests to ensure that sharding and replication work correctly.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a highly scalable and reliable database server with support for sharding and replication, data partitioning and distributed transactions, and database monitoring and alerting. You should also have a set of integration tests that ensure sharding and replication work correctly. Finally, you should have refactored code that is more scalable and easier to maintain.

- Add support for sharding and replication (8 points)
- Implement data partitioning and distributed transactions (5 points)
- Write integration tests for sharding and replication (3 points)
- Implement database monitoring and alerting (5 points)
- Refactor code to improve scalability and maintainability (5 points)

### Sprint 11: Data Archiving, Masking, Encryption and Performance Tuning.

#### Description: 
The focus of this sprint is to implement data archiving and purging, add support for data masking and encryption, and refactor the code to improve scalability and maintainability. Additionally, you will implement database performance tuning and optimization and write integration tests to ensure that data archiving, masking, and encryption work correctly.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a highly secure and optimized database server with support for data archiving and purging, data masking and encryption, and database performance tuning and optimization. You should also have a set of integration tests that ensure data archiving, masking, and encryption work correctly. Finally, you should have refactored code that is more scalable and easier to maintain.

- Implement data archiving and purging (5 points)
- Add support for data masking and encryption (8 points)
- Write integration tests for data archiving, masking, and encryption (3 points)
- Implement database performance tuning and optimization (5 points)
- Refactor code to improve scalability and maintainability (5 points)
